# MNIST Classifier - Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of a digit classifier using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and is widely used for training various image processing systems.

The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify these handwritten digits.
